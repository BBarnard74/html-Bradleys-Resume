    <h1>About Me</h1><hr>
    <p>I'm passionate about security, high levels of customer service, up skilling partners and customers. Building Trust and being trustworthy is extremely important to me. I enjoy growing and building relationship. I focus on personal growth by increasing my knowledge with training and my tenacity is unrivalled. 
        I like to say “Be comfortable with being uncomfortable, because that's where growth happens” don't get comfortable. 
        </p>

        <p>I'm a Family man (2 Daughters 6 and 10-years), I'm a Godly man that's lives by the following principles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>God first</li>
            <li>Family (My Misses and kids)</li>
            <li>Protector of my Family</li>
            <li>Empathy</li>
            <li>Useful</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When I'm not working or studying, I'm spending time with my Fiancé and kids making memories.
            I enjoy reading, rugby, soccer and hitting the gym to let off some steam and it keeps me focused. 
            I try to enjoy every moment and control the controllables.</p>
